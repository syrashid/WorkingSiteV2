              Dear Ms. Rashid,
              <br>
              <br>
              I regret to inform you that Sy will be suspended for 1 week starting April 14, 2005 pending “The Incident”.  “The Incident” mentioned here involved Sy, a cantaloupe filled with gasoline, and an eager friend screaming “You won’t, you won’t!”.  Once the trees behind the school were put out, Sy was apprehended an hour later on the roof of his algebra trailer.
              <br>
              <br>
              This is just the latest in a string of shenanigans where Sy demonstrates reckless behavior and disregard for school property.  Unless curbed soon, I’m afraid Sy will end up potentially endangering himself or others.
              <br>
              <br>
              Sy is an intelligent student with a knack for creativity, perhaps you could introduce him to photography or writing as a means to channel some of his creative energy?  At the very least, get him involved with some of our afterschool clubs or sports teams.
              <br>
              <br>
              He’s got the potential to do anything he sets his mind to, but always find trouble when he doesn’t have positive creative outlets or structure for his energy.  If you have any questions on the terms of his suspension or about any of the aforementioned activities, please do not hesitate to ask.
              <br>
              <br>
              Cordially,
              <br>
              Principal Lauren Holt

          <br>
          <p>
            (Un)Fortunately, my friend’s eye brows grew back and I didn’t end up getting into too much more trouble growing up.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strike>Un</strike>Fortunately, my shenanigans never stopped, I just got better at covering my tracks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Now I spend most of my days building products as a freelance developer.  Not too long ago, I was launching alcohol brands as a serial “intrapreneur”, working for a big corporation, and by all definitions “successful”.  I had a 401K, owned a car, and did my own laundry, all the signs of a mature and successful adult.  And yet, as I’d stare from my WeWork hotdesk I just couldn’t help but feel something was off… so, I quit.
            <br>
            <br>
            I moved to Barcelona, went back to school for coding, and walked out the other side with the realization that had been eluding me at that desk.  For the first time in my life, I wasn’t filling out someone else’s template for what my life should be, instead, I was architecting <b>what I wanted</b> my life to be.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of coding I use my spare time telling stories.  Be it through the lens of a camera, the lines on a piece of paper, or over a beer with friends, telling stories and building/coding products brings me a fulfillment and joy I’ve been desperately seeking since my younger days.
            <br>
            <br>
            I hope through the products, texts, images, or videos on this website you find something that makes you laugh, pulls at a heartstring, or makes you question.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you ever want to work together, send feedback, or just grab a cup of coffee, just send me a message.  Can’t wait to talk soon!
            <br>
            <br>
            Loyally,
            <br>
            Sy
